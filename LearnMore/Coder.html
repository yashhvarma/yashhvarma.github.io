                <p>I started coding since junior college. My First language that I learnt was Python, honestly it is an super easy programming language compared to others. <br>I can say that I got interested in coding is because python provided me a platform for creating anything I can imagine just like I see the game Minecaft. <br>So in this way I got hooked to coding. <br>And I got the ability of logic building. And this helped a lot to learn Java, C and C++ languages.
