                <p>I learnt Python Fundamentals when i was in 11th and 12th. <br>Based on the knowledge of it I made a clean project working on console, which was so loving for me, I used to show it to everyone I meet, link of the source code has been uploaded at the bottom of this page. <br>Currently I'm learning the advanced Python. <br>I also participated into the National level Competetive Programming competition based on the concepts i know of 11th and 12th and unfortunately i was at the 19th rank of qualifying round of the competition. <br> I have the ability of logic bulding. So this is all i am in python.
